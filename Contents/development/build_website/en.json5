        <h1>Build a Website for Free</h1>\
        <hr />\
        <h2>Overview</h2>\
        <p>A blog is used to <strong>record life moments</strong> and share insights (mainly to bypass the strict <strong>content moderation</strong> on social media). However, for beginners, setting up a blog involves buying a server, purchasing a domain name, configuring the environment, registering a certificate, and even filing records with the government—this can be extremely troublesome.</p>\
        <p>We will use <strong>GitHub</strong>, the world\'s largest code hosting platform (it doesn\'t require a VPN if your internet speed is good enough). Many open-source   projects are available there. Now that Microsoft has acquired GitHub, its stability is guaranteed.</p>\
        <hr />\
        <h2>Process</h2>\
        <h3>1. Sign Up for GitHub</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c71f0a990ea.jpg" alt="sign up" />\
        <p> Register a GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com</a>. Enter your username, email, and password, then verify your email address.</p>\
        <h3>2. Create a New Repository</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c721b6c8002.png" alt="create a repository" />\
        <p> Click the <strong>"+"</strong> button in the top right corner and select <strong>"New Repository"</strong> to create a new repository. </p>\
        <h3>3. Set the Repository Name</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c71f0a750fd.png" alt="name repository" />\
        <p>In the <strong>Repository name</strong> field, enter your repository name as <strong>(your GitHub username).github.io</strong> (this will be your domain name). Keep all other  options as default, then click <strong>"Create Repository"</strong>.\</p>\
        <h3>4. Create a Codespace</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c71f0a87768.png" alt="start code" />\
        <p>After entering the repository page, click <strong>"Create a Codespace"</strong> and confirm (this process may take some time).</p>\
        <h3>5. Create an HTML File</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c721b6c30b2.png" alt="index.html" />\
        <p>On your computer, please create a new text file named <strong>index.txt</strong> and write some basic HTML code inside it. Then save the file and rename the extension to <strong>.html</strong>.</p>\
        <h3>6. Upload the File to GitHub</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c721b6112b6.png" alt="frag file" />\
        <p>Drag and drop your <strong>index.html</strong> file into your GitHub repository webpage, then click <strong>"Commit Changes"</strong> at the bottom.</p>\
        <h3>7. Enable GitHub Pages</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c721b72968f.png" alt="github page" />\
        <p>Go to <strong>Settings - Pages</strong>, then change the <strong>branch</strong> option from <strong>None</strong> to <strong>Main</strong> and click <strong>"Save"</strong>. Wait about a minute for deployment.</p>\
        <h3>8. Confirm Deployment</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c71f0a876dc.png" alt="page been built" />\
        <p>Refresh the page, and you should see a success notification.</p>\
        <h3>9. Visit Your Website</h3>\
        <img src="https://img.picui.cn/free/2025/03/04/67c71f0a87e7c.png" alt="result" />\
        <p> Open your browser and visit <strong>(your GitHub username).github.io</strong> — your website is now live! Congratulations on successfully publishing your first personal website.     </p>\
        <hr />\
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\
        <p>While GitHub Pages is free, it does have some limitations:</p>\
        <ul>\
            <li><strong>Repository size:</strong> Limited to 1GB</li>\
            <li><strong>Single file upload limit:</strong> 100MB</li>\
            <li><strong>Monthly bandwidth limit:</strong> 100GB (which is usually sufficient)</li>\
        </ul>\
        <p>To optimize performance, I highly recommend using a domestic <strong>image hosting service</strong> for storing images. This reduces GitHub&#39;s load, saves storage space, and     speeds up access.</p>\
        <p>This tutorial only scratches the surface of website development. To achieve more customization, you should learn <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Thanks   to the rapid advancements in <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>, the future of no-code development looks very promising.</p>\
