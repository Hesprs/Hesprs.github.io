From 31.3.2025 to 3.4.2025, my schoolmates and I were honourably invited to an odyssey at Nanking University Xianlin Campus to explore the rich scholarly atmosphere and state-of-the-art educational concept. It was the very moment for everything to prosper. During these four days, our trip was dipped in the gentle stroke of the spring breeze and bloomed in our pilgrimages toward self-exploration.

This trip is characterised by various lectures on a host of subjects and a bona fide mock-up of university life. I've enrolled on a bunch of courses, mainly about electrical engineering and artificial intelligence concepts. There were also classes traversing national diplomacy, biological pharmaceutics, English skills, and law.

# 🏛️ Symposium of Thinking Sparkles

One of the lectures - The Emergence of Intelligence was truly a mindblower. It was a multi-dimensional exploration of neuroscience, intelligence theorems and philosophy. The teacher first mentioned natural science which serves as the main content of our study, claiming that these subjects are merely fundamental theorems in the great edifice of human cognition. He further introduced the concept of **metaphysics** as an upper step above real science. It is the study of "existence as much". To put it another way, it is the study of the science rules themselves - why the universe is constructed? How free is the will? While normal science may ask: What basic matters construct the cosmos? Or Creatures' will forms in which cerebral cortex? Moreover, the teacher interpreted **theology** as the highest level of the pyramid, for it tries to systematize the issues debated in metaphysics, forming a general interpretation to the populace.

This lecture also discussed the "consciousness" of artificial intelligence and common beings. It didn’t just explain intelligence but also exposed our deep uncertainty about what we are. The emergence of intelligence—whether in cells, minds, or machines—is not just a scientific topic but a metaphysical provocation: Why is there something that knows, rather than nothing?

This reflection leaves me with more questions than answers, which is perhaps the mark of a philosophical lecture. Intelligence, it seems, is not a light we shine on the world but a flickering candle held up in the dark.

# 🔥 The Practise of Soldering

I was once defrauded by the illusion that electronic and electrical engineering is about machine tools, robotic arms and futuristic giant structures like space elevators and orbital cities. The teacher mentioned modelling by a CAD software, which is expected. However, it was je ne sais quoi surprising that the soldering and assembling circuit also took a large amount of the student's time.  On second thought, it is also reasonable that the student's work is to learn, not to say empty words or construct space elevators.

Another insight that I've gained is the rethinking of soldering. In the past, I often witnessed my father holding a soldering iron, and repairing circuit boards from a mosquito swatter or a tiny fan. Before this experience, I used to think the soldering iron was a cool yet formidable tool, for it is often charged with high current and with a temperature of hundreds of Celsius, often accompanied by a smoky smell. In the class, all the students were asked to solder a Keyboard instrument, not until that moment did I realise that soldering is on earth a fairly simple stuff. Nonetheless, making a qualified keyboard was de facto challenging, and what I made was literally a freak - the "keys" were ruggedly aligned while the noise it made was just like the yell of a vampire.

# 🍣 Food, 🏫 Housing and 🚲 Transportation

The culinary odyssey at Nanking University was a delightful paradox. Campus canteens, though unassuming in appearance, served dishes that danced between tradition and innovation. The eleventh canteen near the "众创空间" building became my daily haunt—its _Hongkong cuisine_ achieved a perfect balance of sweetness and fire, while the _shobayaki_ carried whispers between the Orient and the Occident. Yet, the true revelation was the breakfast _jianbing_, which was crisped to perfection.

Housing, however, wore the patina of time. Our dormitory, a relic from the 90 s, greeted us with peeling paint and misaligned floorboards. The poky bathroom, with its hot water which is haggled over every penny, became a test of resilience. To make it worse, I searched and went through every corner back and forth, up and down to seek a trash bin, but it turned out to be a futile endeavour. Late-night homework in those dimly lit rooms (yes, I did homework during this journey every night) somehow morphed into memories I’ll hoard like treasure.

As for traversing the sprawling Xianlin Campus, my strategy was contrary sharply to my peers'. While others zipped past on rental bicycles—a practical choice given the laboursome pathways—I chose to walk. Every corner revealed something new: a pond where a pavilion towers, or a sudden whiff of cool from hidden gardens. Besides, getting lost once or twice only added to the adventure — I’ll admit, envy couldn't gnaw at me whenever a bike breezed by, for the distance travelled was rather short, and a bicycle was too extravagant.

# 📜 Conclusion

Regardless of the well-rounded lectures I've received during these four days, the most precious one is that I ultimately picked some time to manage by myself. Working is like a perpetual odyssey that sucks everyone's passion and pain in. The more we work, the more we need to work. The only solution is to sacrifice more time and impetus and hope that they can assist or mitigate the hardships we shall confront. Everyone below the firmament dives themselves to a pilgrimage toward perfection and eternity, yet born with defects and the certainty of mortality, which is the **essence of life and existence**, and the eternal goal to which we dedicate ourselves as well.
