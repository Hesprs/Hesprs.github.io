## üíª Overview

A blog is used to **record life moments** and share insights (mainly to bypass the strict **content moderation** on social media). However, for beginners, setting up a blog involves buying a server, purchasing a domain name, configuring the environment, registering a certificate, and even filing records with the government‚Äîthis can be extremely troublesome.

We will use üõ†Ô∏è _GitHub_, the world's largest code hosting platform. Many open-source projects are available there. Now that üß∞ _Microsoft_ has acquired üõ†Ô∏è _GitHub_, its stability is guaranteed.

## üìñ Conclusion

While GitHub Pages is free, it does have some limitations (which are usually sufficient):
- **Repository size:** Limited to 1GB
- **Single file upload limit:** 100MB
- **Monthly bandwidth limit:** 100GB

To optimize performance, I highly recommend using a domestic **image hosting service** for storing images. This reduces üõ†Ô∏è_GitHub_'s load, saves storage space, and speeds up access.

This tutorial only scratches the surface of website development. To achieve more customization, you should learn _CSS_ and _JavaScript_. Thanks to the rapid advancements in _large language models (LLMs)_, the future of no-code development looks very promising.
