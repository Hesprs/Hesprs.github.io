This project is a **personal blog** of Hēsperus, run by Github Pages on https://hesprs.github.io. The website is an **SPA** (Single Page Application), where all the website content is scripted and dispalyed on a single HTML page. It is built through **vanilla HTML, JavaScript and SCSS**. All the code except open-source Javascript liberaries is created by Hēsperus himself.

Features:
1. SPA and all its benefits (smooth transition, efficient file structure, neat URL, continuous experience, etc.);
2. Modularized content (technically it can showcase any forms of media no matter articles, mindmaps, web games, etc.);
3. Glassmorphism UI;
4. Simple music player;
5. Internationalization (support English, simplified Chinese, and German);
6. Markdown syntax support;
7. Light and dark mode;
8. Responsive design.

This front-end work uses a very **primitive technology stack** (vanilla HTML, JS and SCSS), making it like a website produced 30 years ago. Hēsperus is now delving into _Node.js_, exploring the magic power of _Vite_, _Vue_, _Slidev_ and _Three.js_.

Libraries used:
- **marked.js** - https://github.com/markedjs/marked
