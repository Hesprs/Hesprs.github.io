        <p>Moonstone is a captivating gemstone known for its unique optical phenomenon called adularescence, which gives it a shimmering, ethereal glow reminiscent of moonlight. This gemstone is primarily composed of sodium potassium aluminum silicate and belongs to the feldspar mineral group. The name "moonstone" derives from its visual effect, where light appears to diffuse through the stone, creating a milky, bluish sheen that can change depending on the angle of light and the thickness of the layers within the stone.</p>\
        <p>Since Moonstone looks a lot like the moonshine, ancient Romans believed that it was formed from moonlight. If you look at the gem closely, you\'ll see a dance of light that lurks on the insides of the gem. Ancient Greeks merged the names of the goddess of love (Aphrodite) and the goddess of the moon (Selene) and christened Moonstone as “Aphroselene”.</p>\
